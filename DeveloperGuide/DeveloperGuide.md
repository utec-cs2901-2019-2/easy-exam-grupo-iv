# Developer guide
## Introduction
Easy exam is a plataform that helps both students and teachers streamline the question creation and validation problem. It does so by allowing teachers to create exams, "buying" an amount of problems with the score of questions that they themselves uploaded previously. Said questions will be rated by the public, filtering out bad problems organically.
